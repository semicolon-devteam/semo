# v0.2.0 (2026-01-06)

## Added

### Scheduler Module
- **TimeoutManager**: Role-specific timeout management with grace period
  - Configurable timeouts per agent role (PO: 10min, FE/BE: 15min, QA: 20min)
  - Grace period before force termination (30s default)
  - Timeout extension on progress

- **RetryManager**: Exponential backoff retry with intelligent error handling
  - Role-specific retry limits (QA: 4, FE/BE: 3, PO/Architect: 2)
  - Non-retryable error pattern detection (permission denied, auth failed, etc.)
  - Jitter factor for distributed retry timing

- **DependencyResolver**: Job dependency graph management
  - Topological sort for execution order
  - Circular dependency detection
  - Cascade failure propagation

- **JobScheduler Enhancement**: Role-based parallel execution limits
  - Configurable concurrency per role (FE: 2, BE: 2, QA: 1, etc.)
  - Integrated timeout, retry, and dependency management

### Session Module
- **OutputMonitor**: Real-time session output analysis
  - Completion pattern detection (PR created, commit pushed, task completed)
  - Error pattern detection with severity classification
  - Progress extraction from output

- **PersonaInjector**: Dynamic CLAUDE.md generation
  - Role-specific persona prompt injection
  - Skill and scope pattern configuration
  - Task context integration

- **SessionPool Enhancement**: Circuit Breaker pattern
  - Failure threshold monitoring (5 failures = open)
  - Half-open state for recovery testing
  - Auto-recovery after cooldown (30s)

### Communication Module (NEW)
- **MessageService**: Priority-based inter-agent messaging
  - Priority levels: urgent (0), high (1), normal (2), low (3)
  - Message expiration and cleanup
  - Read status tracking

- **HandoffService**: Agent task handoff management
  - Handoff reasons: completion, blocked, expertise_needed, review_required
  - Context preservation during handoffs
  - Full handoff lifecycle (pending → accepted → completed)

- **CollaborationService**: Real-time multi-agent collaboration
  - Session-based collaboration with topic focus
  - Participant management with roles
  - Decision recording with consensus tracking

### Workflow Module (NEW)
- **MergeQueue**: Dependency-aware PR merge queue
  - Topological ordering based on job dependencies
  - Priority and creation time tie-breaking
  - Auto-retry on merge failure
  - Concurrent merge prevention

### Realtime Module Enhancement
- **Progress Updates**: Real-time job progress broadcasting
- **UI Events**: Typed event system for UI updates
  - Events: job_started, job_completed, job_failed, pr_created, pr_merged, etc.
- **Agent Animations**: Support for agent state animations
  - Types: idle, thinking, coding, reviewing, testing, deploying, talking, walking

## Changed
- Enhanced `JobScheduler` with integrated timeout, retry, and dependency management
- Enhanced `SessionPool` with Circuit Breaker pattern for fault tolerance
- Enhanced `RealtimeHandler` with progress updates and UI event broadcasting

## Dependencies
- No new external dependencies added
